# Navigating the LLM Job Market

- Track teams doing production agent work and evaluate how much ownership they give individual contributors.
- Highlight hands-on system optimization stories (e.g., accelerating NLME solvers) when pitching your hybrid statistical + LLM skill set.
- Ship small, auditable demos that showcase retrieval, document parsing, and evaluation harnesses—speed matters more than perfection.
- Keep a weekly retro of model experiments and prompt iterations so that learnings stay actionable for hiring conversations.
